        {"Exercise": "Alternating Dumbbell Bench Press", "Explanation": "Lie your back onto a bench while squeezing your shoulder blades together and placing your heels firmly on the ground underneath your knees.\n    The bench should be in contact with your head, shoulders, and butt at all times.\n    Position a dumbbell to rest just outside of our chest in your left hand.\n    Keeping your core braced, extend your left elbow while keeping it at a 45 degree angle from your torso.\n    Once your arm is fully extended over your shoulder, exhale to return the dumbbell back to the starting position.\n    Repeat with opposite side.", "Video": "https://youtu.be/IODxDxX7oi4"},
        {"Exercise": "Around the Worlds", "Explanation": "Lie your back onto a bench with your feet positioned under your knees.\n    Grab ahold of a pair of dumbbells in both hands and position then beside your hip with your palms facing up.\n    Bring the dumbbells away from your hips (in a horizontal plane) toward an overhead position while keeping your elbows slightly bent.\n    Return the dumbbells back to the starting position and repeat.", "Video": "https://youtu.be/gRVjAtPip0Y"},
        {"Exercise": "Barbell Bench Press\n\t1. Barbell Flat Bench Press\n\t2. Barbell Decline Bench Press\n\t3. Barbell Incline Bench Press", "Explanation": "Lie your back onto a bench while squeezing your shoulder blades together and place your heels firmly on the ground underneath your knees.\n    The bench should be in contact with your head, shoulders, and butt at all times.\n    Grab ahold of the barbell just outside shoulder-width apart before unracking the barbell so that your arms are extended over your shoulders.\n    Keeping your core braced by breathing into your stomach and flexing the abdominal muscles, descend the barbell to your chest by flexing your elbows keeping them at a 45 degree angle from your torso.\n    Gently touch the middle of your chest with the barbell before exhaling the barbell back to the starting position.\n    For incline bench press, the angle is commonly between 30 to 45 degrees, while decline bench press is typically set at a decline of around 10 to 15 degrees. Although the angle of incline and decline can be customised according to the individuals preferences.", "Video": "https://youtu.be/IODxDxX7oi4"},
        {"Exercise": "Cable Chest Press\n \t1.Upright Cable Chest Press   \n \t2.Incline Cable Chest Press", "Explanation": "Place the pulleys to just above shoulder height.\n    Sit with your back pressed against the back rest of the seat while holding the pair of dual pulley handles at chest height, shoulder-width apart, and palms facing down.\n    Brace your core to keep your spine in a stationary neutral position.\n    Exhale to extend your arms forward keeping both handles in front of your shoulders with your elbows just below your shoulders.\n    Once you've reached full arm extension, flex your elbows to bring the handles back to the starting position.", "Video": "https://youtu.be/gRVjAtPip0Y"},
        {"Exercise": "Cable Crossover Fly\n \t1.Standing Cable Crossover Fly\n \t2.Cable Crossover Flat Bench Fly \n\t3. Cable Crossover Incline Bench Fly", "Explanation": "• Standing Cable Crossover:- Place the pulleys to just above head height.\n    Stand in an upright staggered stance while holding the pair of dual pulley handles with arms laterally extended at shoulder height and palms facing forward, slightly angled down.\n    Brace your core to keep your spine in a stationary neutral position.\n    Keep your arms extended and create a wide arc to flex the handles together at the bottom of your ribcage.\n    Return back to the starting position.\n\n    • Cable Crossover Flat Bench Fly:- Position and lay back on a flat bench directly between two cables such that the middle of your chest is in line with the cables.\n    Grasp a handle in each hand such that your palms are facing up.\n    Engage your chest to arc the cables in front of your chest until the handles are almost touching.\n    Tense your chest and hold this position for a moment at the top of the movement.\n    Slowly allow the cables to return to the starting position while maintaining tension in your chest.\n    Maintain good posture by keeping your head, shoulders and hips in contact with the bench at all times as well as maintaining a slight bend in your elbows.\n    You should feel the tension in your chest.\n\n    • Cable Crossover Incline Bench Fly:- Position and sit on an incline bench between two cables and grasp a handle in each hand.\n    Tense your chest to raise the weight while pulling the cables in an arc up and in front of you.\n    Hold this position for a moment at the top of the movement while maintaining tension in your chest.\n    Slowly allow the weights to descend back into the starting position while maintaining tension in your chest.\n    Maintain good posture by keeping your head, shoulders and hips in contact with the bench as well as keeping a slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement.\n    You should feel this exercise primarily in your chest.", "Video": "https://youtu.be/gRVjAtPip0Y"},
        {"Exercise": "Chest Dip", "Explanation": "Suspend yourself on a set of parallel bars. Allow your torso to lean forwards and your elbows to slightly flare out away from your body.\n    Control your body as you descend into the starting position. If you feel a stretch in your chest this is a good sign you are in the correct position.\n    Engage your chest to raise your body while driving the palms of your hands down through the parallel bars. Don't lock out your elbows at the top of the movement.\n    Maintain good body positioning by keeping your torso at a slight forward angle.\n    You should feel this exercise primarily in your chest, but may feel some tension in your triceps as well.", "Video": "https://youtu.be/IODxDxX7oi4"},
